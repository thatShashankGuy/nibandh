This project is more than just a collection of notes; it's a growing guidebook, shaped by experiences and insights, tailored to assist both beginners and experienced tech enthusiasts alike.

## About the Project

**_InSights** is born out of a simple idea: learning from shared experiences.Sharing Notes, cruising through many many articles, I came up with this project where I and many developers like me can share the knowledge on various technical things for a broader audience who may or may not have come across documentations but lack insights of a seasoned user of the said tech. 

The content ranges from quick reference notes, best practices, tips and tricks, to deeper dives into specific technologies. It's a living document, constantly updated and refined to reflect the latest in tech trends and knowledge.
